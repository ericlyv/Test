# Test
Trying github

Commit 1: A commit is a saved edit made to a file.

Commit 2: I committed changes after commit 1, but couldn't make any changes to the file until I open a pull request.

I think that once a request has been pulled it, shows up in the pull request tab and await for colleagues or other people working on the repo maybe to see the changes you made to the branch first. Then if they think the changes are good, they will approve and then you can merge the commits.

After making commit 1 and pulled a request, I went back to the branch and was able to open and edit this file.

These are the commit I made.

I will pull request and see if it adds up to the previous commit.

Commit 3: Success. It added to the first edits and the second edits added to the first. It showed the time I made the second edits in the history.

Next, I will add 4 texts to delete and delete one of them before committing changes to see if I can see any changes done before committing are saved.

It should show 1 red line (the one I deleted) if so.


Commit 4: The changes are not saved. There was no red line or sign that I deleted a line above.

The change is made if I delete after committing.

Now that I deleted, it should show red lines.

I noticed that I can create new pull requests???

I will try to pull a new one after this commit to see what happens.


Commit 5: Changes are seens. All deleted or changed texts show as red and the new text is displayed below it.

I clicked on pull new request and selected the test-edits (a.k.a this branch) but it only brings me to compare this branch to the master.

I guess you cannot pull new requests but you can make more commits.

I will merge now to master now.


Commit 6: I merged the edits and deleted the branch.

THe edits has overidden the master file. 

Cannot see the changes made/history (green/red lines).

I am making this commit directly to the master after merge.

So, I guess the changes can only be seen after making commits and pulling requests before merging to master.

Better create a branch before making changes to avoid accidentally making changes to master. That way any edits made to the branch won't affect the master and original work can be recovered if needed.
