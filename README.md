# Test
Trying github

Commit 1: A commit is a saved edit made to a file.

Commit 2: I committed changes after commit 1, but couldn't make any changes to the file until I open a pull request.

I think that once a request has been pulled it, shows up in the pull request tab and await for colleagues or other people working on the repo maybe to see the changes you made to the branch first. Then if they think the changes are good, they will approve and then you can merge the commits.

After making commit 1 and pulled a request, I went back to the branch and was able to open and edit this file.

These are the commit I made.

I will pull request and see if it adds up to the previous commit.

Commit 3: Success. It added to the first edits and the second edits added to the first. It showed the time I made the second edits in the history.

Next, I will add 4 texts to delete and delete one of them before committing changes to see if I can see any changes done before committing.

It should show 1 red line (the one I deleted) if so.
